## Short Description

The project focuses on demand forecasting, a vital process for anticipating customer demand using historical data and other factors. Accurate demand forecasting helps businesses make informed decisions regarding market potential, pricing, and growth strategies. Neglecting this can lead to poor decisions affecting supply chain management and profitability.

Our project offers AI-based logistics optimization for bike outdoor rental, with potential applications in other outdoor rental services. We employ regressors to predict future demand based on past rental data. Variables influencing rental behavior include weather, day of the week, and time of day.

Our work serves several purposes, such as aiding maintenance scheduling, optimizing vehicle allocation, and providing insights for rental startups. By implementing forecasting models like Random Forest regressors and Artificial Neural Networks, we aim to enhance demand forecasting in the bike-sharing and Public Vehicle Rental Space, gaining insights into consumer behavior and its business impact.
